What is RFM Analysis?

RFM analysis, which stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, is a technique that helps marketers identify their most valuable customers. By studying the behavior of your customer base, this analysis allows you to tailor personalized marketing strategies that boost customer loyalty and lifetime value.

RFM analysis helps you identify which customers to invest in, which to nurture, and which are less critical to business results.  RFM in e-commerce helps identify valuable customers based on recent and frequent purchases, segmenting them for targeted promotions to drive repeat purchases and boost sales through personalized offers.

Each of its components reflects a key aspect of customer behavior:

Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase.Indicates engagement and potential interest. Customers who have purchased recently are more likely to respond to marketing efforts and promotions.

Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase.Measures loyalty and ongoing engagement. Frequent buyers have greater attachment to the business and can be targeted with loyalty programs or special offers.

Monetary Value: How much a customer spends.Reflects customer value and profitability. High spenders are valuable for driving revenue and can be rewarded with exclusive perks.
